State of Public Badges Project
==============================

## 27/01/202

### What did we accomplish so far?

+ Mapped the domain of evidence-based ethical certification of internet 
  products and translated it into data models

+ Build and deployed the infrastructure for badge issuance.

+ Build and deployed a registry of organizations

+ Translated the problem domain and our solution to a user-centric design 
  language 

+ Released a framework-agnositic front-end component (public badges drawer) 
  that organizations can embed in their websites 

+ Rolled out the zero badge and the drawer to 1 organization
  [offcourse-studio.com](offcourse-studio.com) today, and two
  more ([waag.org](https://waag.org) and [vpro.nl](https://vpro.nl)) in the 
  next two weeks

+ Open Sourced the code along with core documentation and tools

### What is necessary for the 1.0 release?

+ Frontend and backend need to be tested in production environments

+ Refactoring, small additional features, and bug fixes on the basis 
  of the aforementioned tests

+ Better documentation


### What follows after that?

1. Adoption 

+ More Valuecases / best practices

+ Bottom up approach

+ Adapt badges for use with other kinds of internet services, for instance:
  - Products / Apps
  - Open source projects
  - Protocols


2. Mapping Ethical Internet

+ What are we going to measure?

+ How are we going to measure it?

+ How are we going to value this?


+ How do we translate this information into actionable feedback


3. Interventions

Three consectutive levels of involvement Public Spaces.

1. Rendering initiatives and projects visible for broader audiences

2. Connecting initiatives and projects, matching between projects and potential
   clients 

3. (Application for) Funding of infrastructural projects that can never be
   commercially sustainable
